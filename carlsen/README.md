E2E tests

## Nomenclature
Magnus Carlsen may go down as the greatest chess player of all time. He plays virtually perfect games; in some games, computer analyses have shown that he played the best moves from start to finish. His end-to-end perfection is fitting for our end-to-end tests, which also are designed to be error-free.
