Node.js backend

## Nomenclature
Bobby Fischer was a machine - objective, cold, and calculating. He once said that the only thing that mattered in chess is good moves. Because the backend is oftentimes described as the "logical" part of the application, it was a no-brainer to name this codebase after him.
